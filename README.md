# Telephone Number Validator

A basic US phone number validator.

This is a part of my FreeCodeCamp [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/). It's the fourth project in the module. The code passes all of the tests in the [project requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator). See for yourself!
